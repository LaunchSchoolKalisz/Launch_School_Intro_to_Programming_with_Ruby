What does the following error message tell you?
SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
  
  The user was trying to create a hash but she closed the hash with
  ")" rather than "}"... or maybe she opened the statement with the
  incorrect character. Either way, something is mis-matched in this 
  user's code
