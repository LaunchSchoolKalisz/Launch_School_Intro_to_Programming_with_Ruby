Write a program that calculates the squares
of 3 float numbers of your choosing and outputs 
the result to the screen.
=end

squares1 = 3.3 * 3.3
squares2 = 393.393 * 393.393
#Another solution: ** signifies exponent, or raise to the power of
squares3 = 3393.3393 ** 2

puts squares1
puts squares2
puts squares3
